# Tech Deck

**The IT operations cockpit for MSPs and senior technical teams.**

A multi-tenant SaaS platform that centralizes IT documentation, infrastructure inventory, networks, runbooks, tickets, scripts, evidence, automation, and technician workflows. Built for managed service providers, internal IT teams, and solo technicians who are tired of stitching together disconnected tools.

> Tech Deck is part of the **Shotgun Ninjas Productions** product ecosystem. See [ecosystem](#ecosystem) below for sister platforms.

## Ecosystem

Tech Deck is one focused tool in the Shotgun Ninjas Productions suite. Each product solves a specific operational problem; they are designed to interoperate but stand alone.

| Product | Domain | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Tech Deck** *(this app)* | techdeck.app | IT operations cockpit — documentation, infrastructure, networks, tickets, evidence, automation, audit |
| TradeFlowKit | tradeflowkit.com | Business ops — leads → quotes → jobs → invoices pipeline |
| TorqueShed | torqueshed.pro | Automotive diagnostics, repair cases, mechanic community |
| PulseDesk | pulsedesk.support | Healthcare operations coordination |
| FaultlineLab | faultlinelab.com | Diagnostic challenges & technical problem-solving training |
| ShotgunNinjaVillage | shotgunninjavillage.com | Community, games, merch, creator content |
| ShotgunNinjas.com | shotgunninjas.com | Ecosystem hub — full catalog and brand home |

**Natural pairings for Tech Deck users:**
- **TradeFlowKit** — for IT shops that also need to run sales/quoting/invoicing
- **FaultlineLab** — to train and certify bench techs on real diagnostic scenarios
- **ShotgunNinjas.com** — the central brand hub

| **Service Desk** | Tickets, SLA profiles, dispatch calendar, recurring work, time tracking, invoicing, and client portal workflows |
| **IT Ops Console** | AI-assisted diagnostics, script generation, deep-dive analysis, network analysis, and saved operational knowledge |
| **Secure Intake** | Tenant-scoped upload spaces, expiring requests, external upload links, review workflows, policies, storage, and audit |
| **Evidence Locker** | Upload, tag, search, preview, and download evidence files with SHA-256 deduplication |
| **License Server** | Products, key issuance/revocation, activation tracking, public validation API |
| **Webhooks** | Outbound delivery with HMAC-SHA256 signing, retries, SSRF protection, delivery logs |
| **Status Pages** | Public status pages with component monitoring and incident tracking |
| **Compliance Reports** | ZIP evidence packets with manifest, checksums, audit trail |

## Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript, wouter (routing), TanStack Query v5 (data), shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS (UI)
- **Backend**: Express + TypeScript (single port serves API and SPA)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM
- **Auth**: OperatorOS SSO for production launches, with local password auth reserved for dev/test and emergency system-admin access
- **Storage**: Local disk via `StorageProvider` abstraction (S3-ready)
- **Events**: In-process typed event bus with automatic audit logging

---

## Quick Start (Replit)

1. **Create a Repl** — import this repo or fork the project.
2. **Provision a database** — use the built-in Replit Postgres (automatically sets `DATABASE_URL`).
3. **Set required secrets** in the Secrets tab:

   | Secret | Purpose |
   |--------|---------|
   | `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string (auto-set by Replit DB) |
   | `SESSION_SECRET` | Random string for signing session cookies |

   Production instances also require the OperatorOS SSO secrets listed below.

4. **Push the schema**:
   ```
   npm run db:push
   ```
5. **Run**:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

The app starts on port 5000 and serves both the API and the frontend.

### Production build

```
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Optional Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` | `25` | Max evidence upload size in MB |
| `API_ONLY` | `false` | Headless mode — serves only `/api/v1` and `/health` |
| `ALLOW_INTERNAL_WEBHOOKS` | `false` | Permit webhook URLs targeting private IPs (dev only) |
| `DEV_AUTH_BYPASS` | `false` | Skip normal session login in development |
| `DEV_USER_ID` | `dev-user` | User ID when auth bypass is active |
| `DEV_USER_EMAIL` | `dev@localhost` | Email when auth bypass is active |
| `DEV_TENANT_SLUG` | `dev` | Tenant slug when auth bypass is active |

## OperatorOS SSO

Tech Deck is an OperatorOS child application. Production access is launched through `GET /sso?token=<jwt>`, validated locally, consumed through OperatorOS, and then converted into a Tech Deck session.

Required production env vars:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `MODULE_SSO_SECRET` | Shared HS256 SSO secret, at least 32 characters |
| `OPERATOROS_BASE_URL` | Canonical OperatorOS base URL and default expected issuer |
| `OPERATOROS_ISSUER` | Optional canonical issuer override; defaults to `OPERATOROS_BASE_URL` |
| `OPERATOROS_API_URL` | OperatorOS API base used for `/v1/modules/sso/consume` |
| `OPERATOROS_SSO_ENV` | Exact environment claim to accept |
| `OPERATOROS_SSO_AUDIENCE` | Must be `techdeck` |
| `OPERATOROS_SERVICE_TOKEN` | Server-to-server entitlement sync token, at least 32 characters |
| `CHILD_APP_MODULE_KEY` | Must be `techdeck` |
| `VITE_OPERATOROS_URL` | Browser recovery link for access denied; falls back to `VITE_OPERATOROS_BASE_URL` |

Direct registration is disabled in production. Direct password login is limited to explicit local system-admin emergency accounts; normal users must launch from OperatorOS.

See [OperatorOS SSO Contract](docs/OPERATOROS_SSO.md) for claim validation, consume behavior, entitlement sync, revocation, and local-login policy.

## Module System

Modules are registered in `shared/modules/index.ts` and implemented as:

- **Server routes**: `server/modules/<module>/routes.ts`
- **Client pages**: `client/src/modules/<module>/...`

Each module declares its own events, navigation items, and role restrictions. Enabled modules automatically appear in the sidebar.

## Security

- Tenant-scoped data isolation on every query
- Role-based authorization enforced server-side
- Uploads validated and hashed (SHA-256) for integrity and dedup
- API tokens and license keys stored as SHA-256 hashes
- Webhook payloads signed with HMAC-SHA256; SSRF protection with DNS lookup
- Session cookies: httpOnly, secure, sameSite=lax
- Security headers and CSP in production
- Append-only audit log
